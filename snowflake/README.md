# Snowflake Setup Instructions

## Problem You're Facing

❌ **YAML upload error**: `Table 'BUGREWIND.GIT_ANALYSIS.PR_GENERATIONS' does not exist`
❌ **RUN DEMO error**: 500 Internal Server Error on `/api/cortex-showcase/llm-functions/demo`

**Root cause**: The `PR_GENERATIONS` table doesn't exist in Snowflake yet.

---

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Tables in Snowflake

1. **Open Snowflake Snowsight** (your Snowflake web UI)
2. **Click "Worksheets"** (left sidebar)
3. **Create new worksheet** (blue "+" button)
4. **Copy the entire contents** of `setup_tables.sql` (in this folder)
5. **Paste into worksheet**
6. **Click "Run All"** (or press Cmd+Enter / Ctrl+Enter)

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Table PR_GENERATIONS created
✓ Table COMMITS created
✓ 8 rows inserted into PR_GENERATIONS
✓ 5 rows inserted into COMMITS
✓ Verification queries show data
```

### Step 2: Test RUN DEMO Button

1. **Refresh your dashboard** at http://localhost:3002
2. **Click "RUN DEMO"** button (Cortex LLM Functions section)
3. **Should see**: 4 boxes populate with real Snowflake Cortex results:
   - SENTIMENT: Score like `0.85`
   - SUMMARIZE: Text summary
   - COMPLETE: LLM-generated explanation
   - EXTRACT: Extracted answer

**If it still fails**:
```bash
# Restart backend to refresh Snowflake connection
cd backend
python run.py
```

---

### Step 3: Upload YAML (Cortex Analyst)

1. **In Snowflake Snowsight**, go to:
   - Data → Databases → BUGREWIND → GIT_ANALYSIS

2. **Click "Create"** → **"Cortex Analyst Semantic Model"**

3. **Upload file**: `cortex_analyst_semantic_model.yaml`

4. **Test natural language query**:
   ```
   How many PRs were generated this week?
   ```

**Expected**: Cortex Analyst converts to SQL and returns results.

## What Each File Does

### `setup_tables.sql` (Run this first!)
- Creates `PR_GENERATIONS` table (stores all generated PRs)
- Creates `COMMITS` table (for Cortex Search demo)
- Inserts 8 sample PRs (different models, times, features)
- Inserts 5 sample commits
- Grants permissions

### `cortex_analyst_semantic_model.yaml` (Upload after tables exist)
- Enables natural language SQL queries
- Defines table structure and synonyms
- Allows judges to ask "How many PRs this week?" instead of writing SQL

---

## Sample Data Included

**8 PRs across different scenarios**:
- Mobile login responsive fix (2 hours ago)
- Dark mode toggle (5 hours ago)
- Fuzzy search update (8 hours ago)
- Auth 401 bug fix (1 day ago)
- OAuth provider (2 days ago)
- Dashboard optimization (3 days ago)
- User profile with avatar (4 days ago)
- WebSocket memory leak (5 days ago)

**3 AI models used**:
- `mistral-large` (most PRs)
- `llama3-70b` (2 PRs)
- `mixtral-8x7b` (1 PR)

**Execution times**: 1987ms - 4250ms (realistic range)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Table already exists" error
- **Solution**: Tables already created, skip to Step 2

### "Access denied" error
- **Solution**: Run this in Snowflake:
  ```sql
  GRANT ALL ON DATABASE BUGREWIND TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
  GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA GIT_ANALYSIS TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
  ```

### RUN DEMO still shows 500 error
- **Check backend logs**: Should show "Cortex LLM demo failed: ..."
- **Restart backend**: `cd backend && python run.py`
- **Test endpoint directly**:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000/api/cortex-showcase/llm-functions/demo
  ```

### YAML upload says "Invalid schema"
- **Cause**: Tables don't exist yet
- **Solution**: Run `setup_tables.sql` first

## What Judges Will See (After Setup)

1. **Dashboard at http://localhost:3002**:
   - Active Models: Mistral-Large, Llama 3 70B, Mixtral 8x7B
   - Key Metrics: 8 PRs Generated, 94% Cost Savings, ~2800ms Avg Time
   - Performance Gauges: All showing real data

2. **RUN DEMO button**:
   - Click → 4 Cortex LLM functions execute
   - Results populate in real-time
   - Proves you're using Snowflake AI

3. **Cortex Analyst** (after YAML upload):
   - Natural language queries work
   - "How many PRs were generated this week?" → Instant SQL + results

---

## Next Steps After Setup

1. ✅ Tables created with sample data
2. ✅ RUN DEMO button works
3. ✅ YAML uploaded successfully
4. ✅ Dashboard shows real Snowflake data

**Now you can**:
- Demo to judges with confidence
- Show live Cortex LLM functions
- Query data in natural language
- Prove it's not "forced Snowflake" - it's production-ready!
