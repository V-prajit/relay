## 🚀 The Manual Steps (Can't Automate These)

### In Postman Desktop:
1. **Deploy your Flow as Action**
   - Flows → Your flow → Deploy button
   - Copy the public URL
   - Add to Postman Environment as `ACTION_PUBLIC_URL`

2. **Add webhook to Environment**
   - After creating Slack webhook (below)
   - Add variable: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_PM`
   - Value: Slack webhook URL

### In Slack (api.slack.com/apps):
1. **Create new app** → "From scratch"
2. **Add slash command** → `/impact`
3. **Enable incoming webhooks** → Add to #new-channel
4. **Install app** to workspace

### In Slack App (#new-channel):
1. **Test the command:** `/impact test feature`
2. **Wait 30 seconds**
3. **See notification** ✅
