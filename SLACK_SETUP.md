## Part 3: Update Postman Environment

### Step 3.1: Add Slack Webhook URL

1. In Postman, go to **Environments**
2. Select your active environment
3. Find or add variable:
   - **Variable:** `SLACK_WEBHOOK_PM`
   - **Initial Value:** `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../xxx` (from Step 2.3)
   - **Current Value:** (same)
   - **Type:** secret (recommended for webhooks)
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3.2: Verify All Required Variables

Make sure your environment has these variables set:

```
‚úÖ ACTION_PUBLIC_URL = https://flows-action.postman.com/{your-id}
‚úÖ SLACK_WEBHOOK_PM = https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../xxx
‚úÖ GITHUB_TOKEN = ghp_... (with repo scope)
‚úÖ REPO_OWNER = V-prajit (or your GitHub username)
‚úÖ REPO_NAME = youareabsolutelyright
‚úÖ RIPGREP_API_URL = http://localhost:3001
‚úÖ SNOWFLAKE_ENDPOINT = http://localhost:8000/api/snowflake/generate-pr
```

---

## Part 4: Update Postman Flow (If Needed)

### Step 4.1: Verify Start Block

1. Open your Postman Flow
2. Click the **Start** block
3. Verify it can handle Slack's slash command payload format:
   ```json
   {
     "text": "fix mobile login",
     "user_id": "U123ABC",
     "user_name": "alice",
     "channel_id": "C456DEF",
     "channel_name": "new-channel"
   }
   ```
4. The important field is `text` - your flow should reference it as `{{Start.text}}`

### Step 4.2: Verify Slack Notification Block

1. Find your **Slack Notification** HTTP block (usually near the end)
2. Click on it to edit
3. Verify:
   - **Method:** POST
   - **URL:** `{{SLACK_WEBHOOK_PM}}`
   - **Body:** Your Block Kit JSON message
4. The URL MUST use the environment variable, not hardcoded

### Step 4.3: Add Immediate Response (Optional but Recommended)

Slack requires a response within 3 seconds. To avoid timeouts:

1. Right after **Start** block, add new **Send** block
2. Configure:
   - **Status Code:** 200
   - **Body:**
     ```json
     {
       "response_type": "in_channel",
       "text": "‚è≥ Processing your request: {{Start.text}}"
     }
     ```
3. Connect: `Start ‚Üí Send ‚Üí (rest of flow)`

This shows immediate feedback in Slack while your workflow runs.

## Part 5: Test the Integration

### Step 5.1: Start All Services

Open 2 terminals:

**Terminal 1: Backend (Snowflake)**
```bash
cd backend
python run.py
```
Wait for: `Server running on: http://localhost:8000`

**Terminal 2: Ripgrep API**
```bash
cd ripgrep-api
npm run dev
```
Wait for: `Server running on port 3001`

### Step 5.2: Verify Health

In a third terminal or browser:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy",...}

curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok",...}
```

### Step 5.3: Test in Slack

1. Go to **#new-channel** in Slack
2. Type test message:
   ```
   /impact test feature request
   ```
3. Press **Enter**

**Expected behavior:**
- Slack shows: "‚è≥ Processing your request: test feature request"
- (If you watch Postman Flows console, you'll see blocks executing)
- After ~30 seconds, notification appears in channel

### Step 5.4: Debug if Needed

**If command not recognized:**
- Reinstall Slack app (Part 2, Step 2.5)
- Verify command appears when you type `/` in Slack

**If "dispatch_failed" error:**
- Check Action URL is correct in slash command config
- Test Action URL with curl:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://flows-action.postman.com/{your-id} \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text":"test"}'
  ```

**If timeout after 3 seconds:**
- Add immediate response block (Part 4, Step 4.3)

**If no notification appears:**
- Check `SLACK_WEBHOOK_PM` is set correctly
- Test webhook directly:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../xxx \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text":"test notification"}'
  ```
- Verify webhook was created for #new-channel (not a different channel)

**If Postman Flow errors:**
- Check Postman Flows console for error messages
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Check backend services are running

---

## Part 6: Full Demo Test

Now test the complete 3-person workflow:

### Test Scenario

1. **Customer posts complaint:**
   ```
   The mobile login page is broken! Can't sign in on iPhone üò°
   ```

2. **PM responds with command:**
   ```
   /impact fix mobile login responsive design
   ```

3. **Watch Postman Flows console:**
   - Ripgrep searches for "mobile login"
   - Checks open PRs
   - Calls Snowflake Cortex
   - Creates GitHub PR
   - Posts notification

4. **Engineer sees notification:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Task Created: fix-mobile-login
   Feature Request: fix mobile login responsive design
   Files Impacted: 2
   [View PR] button
   ```

5. **Click "View PR"** ‚Üí Opens GitHub PR

**Success criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Full workflow completes in 20-40 seconds
- ‚úÖ GitHub PR is created with actual content
- ‚úÖ Notification appears in same channel
- ‚úÖ All 3 personas (customer, PM, engineer) visible in conversation

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "/impact command not showing"
**Symptoms:** Type `/` in Slack, don't see `/impact`

**Solutions:**
1. Check app is installed: Slack settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Look for "PM Copilot"
2. Reinstall app: api.slack.com/apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Install App ‚Üí Reinstall
3. Check command was created: api.slack.com/apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Slash Commands
4. Try in a different channel (permissions might differ)

---

#### Issue: "dispatch_failed" error
**Symptoms:** Slack shows red error: "dispatch_failed"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Action URL is correct:
   - Go to api.slack.com/apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Slash Commands
   - Check Request URL matches your Postman Action URL
2. Test Action URL with curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST {your-action-url} -d '{"text":"test"}'
   ```
3. Re-deploy Postman Flow:
   - Postman ‚Üí Your Flow ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Save new URL
   - Update Slack slash command Request URL

---

#### Issue: Timeout after 3 seconds
**Symptoms:** Slack shows: "Operation timed out"

**Solutions:**
1. Add immediate response block (see Part 4, Step 4.3)
2. This responds to Slack immediately while workflow runs
3. Alternative: Use Slack's "Delayed Response" API (more complex)

---

#### Issue: No notification appears
**Symptoms:** Command works, but no message in channel

**Solutions:**
1. Check webhook URL:
   - Postman Environment ‚Üí `SLACK_WEBHOOK_PM` ‚Üí Verify URL
2. Test webhook directly:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST {your-webhook-url} \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text":"test"}'
   ```
3. Verify webhook is for #new-channel:
   - api.slack.com/apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Incoming Webhooks
   - Check which channel the webhook posts to
4. Check Postman Flow Slack block:
   - URL should be `{{SLACK_WEBHOOK_PM}}`
   - NOT hardcoded URL

---

#### Issue: Postman Flow errors
**Symptoms:** Flow starts but blocks fail

**Solutions:**
1. Check Postman Flows console for error messages
2. Verify all services running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
   ```
3. Check environment variables are set:
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   - `REPO_OWNER`
   - `REPO_NAME`
   - `RIPGREP_API_URL`
   - `SNOWFLAKE_ENDPOINT`
4. Test each service individually (see troubleshooting docs)

---

#### Issue: GitHub PR not created
**Symptoms:** Flow completes but no PR in GitHub

**Solutions:**
1. Check GitHub token:
   - github.com/settings/tokens
   - Verify token has `repo` scope
   - Generate new token if needed
2. Check repository name:
   - Verify `REPO_OWNER` and `REPO_NAME` are correct
3. Check Postman Flows console:
   - Look for GitHub API errors
   - Common: 404 (repo not found), 401 (auth failed)

## Security Considerations

### Webhook URL Security
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit webhook URLs to git**
- ‚úÖ Use Postman environment variables (marked as "secret")
- ‚úÖ Rotate webhooks if exposed
- ‚úÖ Use separate webhooks for dev/prod

### Slack App Permissions
- ‚úÖ Only grant necessary scopes (`chat:write`, `commands`)
- ‚úÖ Don't request `admin` or `files:read` unless needed
- ‚úÖ Review permissions before installing

### Token Management
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never hardcode tokens in Postman collections
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables
- ‚úÖ Mark sensitive variables as "secret" type
- ‚úÖ Rotate tokens regularly

---

## Next Steps

Once Slack integration works:

1. ‚úÖ **Test multiple times** - Make sure it's reliable
2. ‚úÖ **Practice demo** - Use `DEMO_SCRIPT_SLACK.md`
3. ‚úÖ **Create backup materials** - Screenshots, video recording
4. ‚úÖ **Document for judges** - Explain the workflow clearly
5. ‚≠ê **Agentverse deployment** - Your teammate handles bonus points

## Reference: Slack Slash Command Payload

When someone types `/impact fix mobile login`, Slack sends this to your Postman Action URL:

```json
{
  "token": "verification_token",
  "team_id": "T01ABC123",
  "team_domain": "your-workspace",
  "channel_id": "C01DEF456",
  "channel_name": "new-channel",
  "user_id": "U01GHI789",
  "user_name": "alice",
  "command": "/impact",
  "text": "fix mobile login",
  "api_app_id": "A01JKL012",
  "is_enterprise_install": "false",
  "response_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/commands/...",
  "trigger_id": "123456789.987654321.abcdef"
}
```

**Key fields your flow uses:**
- `text` - The feature request text
- `user_name` - Who triggered the command
- `channel_name` - Where it was triggered
