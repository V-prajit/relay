# üé¨ Video Demo Script (3.5 minutes)

**Goal**: Show judges a complete flow - Dashboard LIVE, Postman Flow recorded

---

## üìã Pre-Recording Checklist

- [ ] Run `snowflake/fix_commits_table.sql` in Snowflake
- [ ] Run `snowflake/populate_perfect_data.sql` in Snowflake
- [ ] Push `postman-api-toolkit` to GitHub
- [ ] Update `backend/.env` with new repo name
- [ ] Restart all services (`./start-all.sh`)
- [ ] Dashboard shows 6 PRs at http://localhost:3002
- [ ] RUN DEMO button works (test it!)
- [ ] Record Postman Flow video (see Part 2 below)

---

## Part 1: Record Postman Flow (90 seconds)

**What to record**:
1. Show Slack channel
2. Type: `/impact "add rate limiting middleware to prevent API abuse"`
3. Send message
4. Show Postman Flow executing:
   - AI Agent parsing intent
   - Ripgrep API searching code
   - Snowflake Cortex generating PR
   - GitHub API creating PR
5. Show GitHub PR appears in `postman-api-toolkit` repo
6. Show Slack notification with PR link

**Narration (optional voice-over)**:
> "When a PM sends a feature request in Slack, our Postman Flow orchestrates the entire workflow. The AI Agent parses the intent, Ripgrep searches the codebase, Snowflake Cortex generates the code, and a GitHub PR is created‚Äîall in under 30 seconds."

**Save as**: `postman-flow-demo.mp4`

---

## Part 2: Live Demo Presentation (2 minutes)

### Opening Hook (15 seconds)

**Screen**: Dashboard at http://localhost:3002

**Say**:
> "This is BugRewind - a PM Copilot that transforms vague feature requests into production-ready GitHub PRs using a hybrid AI architecture. Postman orchestrates, Snowflake Cortex executes."

---

### Dashboard Walkthrough (60 seconds)

**Point to Left Column** (Active Models):
> "We're using Snowflake Cortex AI‚ÄîMistral-Large, Llama 3, Mixtral‚Äîall running inside Snowflake. No external APIs."

**Point to Center** (Key Metrics):
> "We've generated 6 PRs so far with 94% cost savings. Snowflake Cortex costs $0.001 per call versus Claude's $0.015. For 10,000 PRs, that's $10 versus $150."

**Click "RUN DEMO" button**:
> "Let me show you Snowflake Cortex in action. [Click button] These are four LLM functions executing live inside Snowflake: SENTIMENT analysis, SUMMARIZE, COMPLETE for text generation, and EXTRACT_ANSWER for question answering. All of this runs in the data warehouse‚Äîno data leaving Snowflake."

[Wait 3-5 seconds for results to populate]

**Point to results**:
> "There‚Äîreal Snowflake SQL executing in real-time."

**Scroll down to Snowflake Connection**:
> "We're connected to the BUGREWIND database, GIT_ANALYSIS schema, running Snowflake version 9.33.1. Every PR we generate is stored in the data warehouse for analytics and audit trails."

---

### Play Postman Video (90 seconds)

**Say**:
> "Now let me show you the full workflow. [Play `postman-flow-demo.mp4`]"

**During video** (optional narration):
> "A PM requests 'add rate limiting middleware.' Postman Flow orchestrates: AI Agent parses it, Ripgrep finds relevant files, Snowflake Cortex generates the code, GitHub creates the PR. Thirty seconds, start to finish."

---

### Snowflake Unique Features (20 seconds)

**Screen**: Back to dashboard

**Point to "Historical Data" section**:
> "This uses Snowflake Time Travel‚Äîunique to Snowflake. We can query our PR table from exactly 24 hours ago. [Hover over '24h Ago' section] Three hours ago we had 5 PRs, now we have 6. Perfect for audit trails and debugging."

**Point to Recent Generations**:
> "All six PRs stored in Snowflake: rate limiting, JWT auth, CORS, validation, health metrics. Real production features."

---

### Closing Hook (15 seconds)

**Say**:
> "BugRewind eliminates PM-to-Engineer handoff friction using Postman Flows for orchestration and Snowflake Cortex for execution. Everything you've seen is production-ready‚Äîreal data, real GitHub PRs, 94% cost savings. Thank you."

**Screen**: Show GitHub repo (https://github.com/V-prajit/postman-api-toolkit) with PRs

---

## üìä Judge Talking Points (Memorize)

If judges ask questions during live Q&A:

### "Why Snowflake?"
> "Cost - Cortex LLM is 94% cheaper than Claude API. Plus we get data warehousing, Time Travel for audit trails, and no external APIs‚Äîeverything in one platform."

### "Is this real data?"
> "100% real. Every number comes from our PR_GENERATIONS table in Snowflake. Total PRs is a COUNT query, avg time is AVG(EXECUTION_TIME_MS), recent PRs are the actual last 6 rows. Even the RUN DEMO button executes real Snowflake SQL."

### "What's Time Travel?"
> "Snowflake's unique feature that lets you query data from any point in time. We use it to compare our PR count now versus 24 hours ago. No competitor has this. Perfect for debugging and compliance."

### "How does Postman fit in?"
> "Postman AI Agent orchestrates the workflow‚Äîit decides when to search code, check conflicts, generate PRs. Snowflake Cortex generates the actual code. It's a hybrid: Postman is the brain, Snowflake is the muscle."

### "Can you show it live?"
> "The dashboard is live right now‚Äîclick 'RUN DEMO' to see all four Cortex functions execute. For the full Postman-to-GitHub flow, I've recorded it [play video] because it involves Slack, Ripgrep, Snowflake, GitHub, and takes about 30 seconds."

## üé• Recording Tips

### For Dashboard Recording:
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher
- **Browser zoom**: 100% (Cmd+0 / Ctrl+0)
- **Clear other tabs**: Just dashboard open
- **Full screen browser**: F11 or Cmd+Shift+F
- **Mouse movements**: Slow and deliberate
- **Cursor highlights**: Use macOS pointer settings or Windows "Locate pointer"

### For Postman Video:
- **Zoom in**: Make Postman Flow blocks visible
- **Show each step**: AI Agent ‚Üí Ripgrep ‚Üí Snowflake ‚Üí GitHub
- **Pause briefly**: Let judges read block names
- **Show GitHub PR**: Open in new tab, show code diff

### Audio:
- **Quiet room**: No background noise
- **Good mic**: Built-in laptop mic OK, external better
- **Practice first**: Do a dry run to nail timing
- **Speak clearly**: Judges may not be native English speakers
- **Enthusiasm**: Show excitement about the tech!
