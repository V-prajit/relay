## 🎬 Demo Script for Snowflake Judges (60 seconds)

### Opening (10s)
> "This is the Snowflake Cortex Analytics Hub for BugRewind, our PM Copilot that automatically generates GitHub PRs. We've built it ENTIRELY on Snowflake to showcase your platform's AI capabilities."

### Cortex LLM Demo (20s)
> **[Click "Run Live Demo" button]**
>
> "Watch this—I'm running four Cortex LLM functions right now: SENTIMENT analysis, SUMMARIZE, COMPLETE for text generation, and EXTRACT_ANSWER. All of these run INSIDE Snowflake, no external APIs. That's Mistral-Large, Llama, and Mixtral—all built into Cortex. We're paying $0.001 per call instead of Claude's $0.015. That's 94% cost savings."

### Time Travel Demo (15s)
> **[Click "24h Ago" button]**
>
> "Here's Time Travel—unique to Snowflake. I'm querying our PR_GENERATIONS table from exactly 24 hours ago. See? We had X PRs then, we have Y now, that's Z new records. Perfect for audit trails and debugging. No other warehouse can do this."

### Data Warehouse (10s)
> "Every single PR generation is stored in Snowflake's data warehouse. We have [X] PRs stored right now, all queryable with Time Travel, semantic search, and our Cortex Analyst semantic model."

### Closing Hook (5s)
> "Everything you're seeing—the AI, the analytics, the storage—runs entirely inside Snowflake. No Claude API, no OpenAI, just Cortex. That's the power of your platform."

## 🏆 Judge Talking Points (Memorize These!)

### "Why Snowflake?"
> "We chose Snowflake because it's the ONLY platform where we can run AI models, store data, and query historical snapshots all in one place. No external APIs, no data movement, just pure Snowflake."

### "What's Unique?"
> "Time Travel is unique to Snowflake—no other data warehouse lets you query the exact state of a table from 24 hours ago. Perfect for audit trails and debugging."

### "Cost Savings?"
> "Cortex LLM costs $0.001 per generation. Claude API costs $0.015. That's 94% savings at scale. For 10,000 PRs, that's $10 vs $150."

### "Production Ready?"
> "Every PR our system generates is stored in Snowflake's data warehouse. We can run analytics, Time Travel queries, and semantic search on all of them. It's not a demo—it's production infrastructure."

### "AI Inside Snowflake?"
> "All our AI runs inside Snowflake using Cortex. Mistral-Large generates PR descriptions, SENTIMENT detects urgent bugs, SUMMARIZE condenses commit messages. No API keys, no latency, no data leaving Snowflake."

## 🚨 Pre-Demo Checklist

### 5 Minutes Before Judging

1. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   ./start-all.sh
   ```

2. **Open Dashboard**
   - URL: http://localhost:3002
   - Verify green status badge

3. **Test Live Demos**
   - Click "Run Live Demo" (Cortex LLM)
   - Click "24h Ago" (Time Travel)
   - Ensure both return data

4. **Check Snowflake Connection**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/snowflake/health
   ```
   - Must say `"status": "healthy"`

5. **Have Browser Ready**
   - Dashboard open in fullscreen
   - Clear browser cache if needed
   - Zoom to 100%

## 📊 Data Sources (NOT Mock!)

### PR_GENERATIONS Table
- **Location**: BUGREWIND.GIT_ANALYSIS.PR_GENERATIONS
- **Data**: Real PR generations from Snowflake Cortex
- **Columns**: FEATURE_REQUEST, PR_TITLE, BRANCH_NAME, IS_NEW_FEATURE, EXECUTION_TIME_MS, MODEL_USED, GENERATED_AT
- **Updated**: Every time Postman Flow calls `/api/snowflake/generate-pr`

### COMMITS Table (if exists)
- **Location**: BUGREWIND.GIT_ANALYSIS.COMMITS
- **Data**: Git commit history
- **Used for**: Cortex Search, semantic queries

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Snowflake shows unhealthy"
- **Check**: Is backend running? (`curl http://localhost:8000/health`)
- **Fix**: Restart backend (`cd backend && python run.py`)
- **Verify**: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/snowflake/health` should return `"status":"healthy"`

### "Cortex LLM demo shows errors"
- **Cause**: No data in PR_GENERATIONS table
- **Fix**: Generate a test PR via Postman Flow
- **Fallback**: Demo uses sample text if no data

### "Time Travel shows no results"
- **Cause**: No data existed 24 hours ago
- **Fix**: Try shorter time range (12 hours)
- **Note**: Time Travel requires historical data

### "Cost savings shows 'N/A'"
- **Cause**: Features summary not loading
- **Check**: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/cortex-showcase/features-summary`
- **Fix**: Restart backend
