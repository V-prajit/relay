# Hybrid AI Demo Scenario - PM Copilot

## 🎯 The Pitch: Two Brains Are Better Than One

**Problem:** PMs write vague specs. Engineers waste hours clarifying.

**Solution:** Hybrid AI architecture
- **Postman AI Agent (GPT-5)** = Orchestration brain (decides WHEN to call APIs)
- **Snowflake Cortex (Mistral)** = Execution brain (decides WHAT code to write)
- **Result:** 30 seconds from Slack to GitHub PR

---

## 📋 Demo Setup Checklist

### Services Running:
- [ ] Ripgrep API (port 3001): `cd ripgrep-api && npm run dev`
- [ ] Backend API (port 8000): `cd backend && python run.py`
- [ ] Snowflake connected (check `/api/snowflake/health`)

### Browser Tabs (Open in Order):
1. Slack workspace
2. Postman Desktop (Flow view)
3. Terminal (show backend logs)
4. Snowflake Console (queries ready)
5. GitHub repository
6. Slack (for notification)

### Pre-Demo Setup:
- [ ] Import all 6 Postman Flow Modules
- [ ] Create AI Agent Flow with tools registered
- [ ] Deploy Flow as Postman Action
- [ ] Configure Slack webhook
- [ ] Run Snowflake table creation script
- [ ] Test end-to-end once

## 🎬 3-Minute Demo Script

### **0:00-0:30 - The Problem**

**Say:**
> "Imagine you're a PM. A customer reports: 'Login is broken on mobile.' You need to turn this vague complaint into an actionable GitHub PR. Traditionally, this takes hours of back-and-forth with engineers."

**Show:**
- Slack screenshot of customer complaint
- PM typing: `/impact fix mobile login responsive design`

**Key Point:** "With PM Copilot, this becomes instant."

---

### **0:30-1:00 - Trigger the Magic**

**Action:**
1. Type in Slack: `/impact fix mobile login responsive design`
2. Press Enter

**Say:**
> "This triggers our Hybrid AI system. Watch two AI brains collaborate in real-time..."

**Show:**
- Postman Flow starts executing
- AI Agent block activating

**Key Points:**
- "Postman AI Agent orchestrates the workflow"
- "It decides which tools to call and when"

---

### **1:00-1:30 - AI Agent Orchestration**

**Show Postman Flow Execution:**

**Block 1: AI Agent parses intent**
```
AI Agent thinking:
✓ Feature request: "mobile login responsive design"
✓ Search keywords: "login", "mobile", "responsive"
✓ Need to search codebase...
```

**Block 2: AI Agent calls Ripgrep tool**
```
Tool call: Ripgrep Search API
Query: "login mobile"
Result: Found ["src/pages/Login.tsx"]
```

**Block 3: AI Agent calls Snowflake Cortex tool** ⭐
```
Tool call: Snowflake Generate PR
Sending to Snowflake Cortex...
```

**Say:**
> "Now here's where it gets interesting. The AI Agent hands off to Snowflake Cortex to actually generate the PR content. This is the hybrid approach - one AI orchestrates, another executes."

**Key Points:**
- "AI Agent = Smart routing"
- "Cortex = Code generation"
- "Both stored in Snowflake data warehouse"

---

### **1:30-2:00 - Snowflake Cortex in Action**

**Switch to Terminal (show logs):**
```
[INFO] Snowflake Cortex request sent
[INFO] Model: mistral-large
[INFO] Generating PR content...
[INFO] Response received in 2.3 seconds
[INFO] PR Title: fix: Mobile login responsive design
[INFO] Data stored in PR_GENERATIONS table
```

**Say:**
> "Snowflake Cortex just generated the entire PR - title, description, code suggestions - and stored the execution data for analytics."

**Show Results:**
- GitHub PR #99 created
- Slack notification appears

**Key Point:** "From Slack message to GitHub PR in 30 seconds."

---

### **2:00-2:30 - Snowflake Showcase** 🏆

**Switch to Snowflake Console:**

**Query 1: Show stored data**
```sql
SELECT * FROM PR_GENERATIONS ORDER BY GENERATED_AT DESC LIMIT 5;
```
*Show table with recent PR generations*

**Query 2: Live Cortex generation**
```sql
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
    'mistral-large',
    'Write a PR title for: Fix mobile login responsive design'
) as live_generation;
```
*Run this LIVE to show Cortex working*

**Say:**
> "All data lives in Snowflake. We can query it, analyze it, and even use Cortex AI directly for ad-hoc code generation."

**Key Points:**
- "Data warehouse + AI in one platform"
- "No external API needed"
- "Built for analytics and scale"

---

### **2:30-3:00 - The Value Proposition**

**Show final Slack notification:**
```
✅ PR Created: #99
📝 fix: Mobile login responsive design
📂 Files: src/pages/Login.tsx
🤖 Generated by: Postman AI Agent + Snowflake Cortex
⚡ Time: 30 seconds
```

**Say:**
> "This is the power of Hybrid AI:
> - Postman AI Agent orchestrates the entire workflow
> - Snowflake Cortex generates the code
> - Snowflake data warehouse stores everything
> - Engineers get actionable PRs in 30 seconds
> - PMs never write detailed specs again"

**Final Slide:**
```
HYBRID AI ARCHITECTURE

[Slack] → [Postman AI Agent] → [Snowflake Cortex] → [GitHub]
           (Orchestration)        (Code Generation)

✅ Best Use of Postman: AI Agent showcase
✅ Best Use of Snowflake: Cortex LLM + Data Warehouse
✅ Real Impact: 30-second PM→PR pipeline
```
