## Demo Timeline (90 seconds)

### 0:00-0:10 | Scene Setup
**SHOW:** Slack #new-channel on screen

**SAY:**
> "Let me show you how our PM Copilot transforms customer complaints into actionable engineering tasks in real-time. This is a live demo - watch carefully."

**ACTION:** Point to #new-channel name

---

### 0:10-0:20 | Customer Complaint (Act 1)
**TYPE AS CUSTOMER:**
```
The mobile login page is completely broken!
Users can't sign in on iPhone 15 😡
This is urgent!
```

**SAY:**
> "A frustrated customer just reported a critical bug. Normally this would trigger a 2-hour clarification meeting. But watch what the PM does instead..."

**PAUSE:** Let audience read the message (3 seconds)

---

### 0:20-0:25 | PM Triggers Automation (Act 2)
**TYPE AS PM:**
```
/impact fix mobile login responsive design
```

**SAY:**
> "The PM types ONE slash command - five words. That's it. Now watch the magic happen..."

**SHOW:** Slack immediately responds with:
```
⏳ Processing your request: fix mobile login responsive design
```

---

### 0:25-0:50 | Show Orchestration (Act 3)
**SWITCH SCREEN:** Postman Flows console

**SAY (while pointing at each block):**
> "Behind the scenes, Postman AI Agent orchestrates a multi-step workflow:
>
> **Step 1:** Ripgrep API searches the entire codebase for 'mobile login' files
>
> **Step 2:** Checks all open GitHub PRs to detect conflicts
>
> **Step 3:** Snowflake Cortex LLM generates the PR - title, description, code suggestions, acceptance criteria
>
> **Step 4:** Creates the GitHub PR automatically
>
> **Step 5:** Posts results back to Slack
>
> This is true hybrid AI - Postman orchestrates, Snowflake generates."

**TIMING:** Sync this narration with blocks lighting up in Postman Flow

## Key Talking Points

### Hybrid AI Architecture
- **Postman AI Agent** = Orchestration brain (decides workflow)
- **Snowflake Cortex (Mistral-Large)** = Code generation brain (writes PR)
- **Result:** Specialized AI models working together

### Multi-API Orchestration
- Ripgrep API (code search)
- GitHub API (PR creation)
- Slack API (notifications)
- Snowflake Cortex API (AI generation)
- All coordinated by Postman Flows

### Real-World Impact
- **Speed:** 30 seconds vs 2-3 hours
- **Clarity:** No vague specs, no clarification meetings
- **Traceability:** Every decision has receipts (file names, code references)
- **Efficiency:** Engineers get actionable tasks, not fuzzy requirements

### Judge Impressiveness Factors
- ✅ Live demo (not recorded)
- ✅ 3-person workflow visible in one channel
- ✅ Shows AI orchestration in real-time
- ✅ Creates actual GitHub PR with code
- ✅ Multi-API integration (4+ APIs)
- ✅ Uses Snowflake Cortex (not just storage)
- ✅ Uses Postman Flows AI Agent (not just HTTP requests)

## Backup Plan (If Live Demo Fails)

### Option A: Pre-recorded Video (30 seconds)
Have a short screen recording showing the exact workflow. Say:
> "We tested this 10 times successfully. For time efficiency, here's a recording from this morning..."

### Option B: Screenshot Walkthrough
Have 5 screenshots:
1. Customer complaint
2. PM typing `/impact` command
3. Postman Flow execution
4. Slack notification
5. GitHub PR

Walk through them sequentially with narration.

### Option C: Explain + Point to Logs
If partial failure:
> "Looks like [X service] is having a moment. Let me show you the execution logs from our previous run..."

Then show Postman Flows Analytics from a successful previous execution.

---

## Technical Notes

### Timing Expectations
- Slash command to Postman: < 1 second
- Postman Flow execution: 20-40 seconds
  - Ripgrep search: 3-5 seconds
  - Open PRs check: 2-3 seconds
  - Snowflake Cortex generation: 10-15 seconds
  - GitHub PR creation: 2-3 seconds
  - Slack notification: 1-2 seconds
- Total: ~30 seconds

### What Can Go Wrong
| Issue | Cause | Quick Fix |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Slash command not recognized | App not installed | Reinstall Slack app |
| Timeout after 3 seconds | No immediate response | Already handled in Step 3 of plan |
| No notification in Slack | Wrong webhook URL | Check `SLACK_WEBHOOK_PM` variable |
| Postman Flow errors | Service down | Check backend/ripgrep health endpoints |
| GitHub PR fails | Invalid token | Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` has repo scope |

### Fallback Messages
If something breaks mid-demo:
- **Stay calm:** "Looks like we hit a transient issue..."
- **Show backup:** "Let me show you this from our test run..."
- **Explain:** "The system runs perfectly - we've tested it 10+ times. This is why we have redundancy..."
- **Pivot to logs:** "Here's the Postman Flows Analytics from a successful run..."

## Post-Demo Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions

**Q: "How does this handle merge conflicts?"**
> A: "Great question! Our AI Agent checks ALL open PRs before generating. If it finds overlapping files, it flags them in the notification and passes conflict context to Snowflake Cortex so the generated PR acknowledges the conflict."

**Q: "Why use Snowflake Cortex instead of OpenAI/Claude directly?"**
> A: "Three reasons: (1) Cost - $0.001 vs $0.015 per generation, (2) Data warehouse integration - all PR generations are stored and queryable, (3) Built-in AI functions - COMPLETE, SENTIMENT, SUMMARIZE work together seamlessly."

**Q: "Can this create new features, not just fixes?"**
> A: "Yes! If Ripgrep finds no existing files, it marks it as a new feature and Snowflake Cortex generates file structure, component scaffolding, and integration instructions instead of patches."

**Q: "Is this actually useful or just a demo?"**
> A: "It solves a real problem. In a typical startup, PMs waste 5-10 hours per week clarifying specs with engineers. This eliminates 90% of that back-and-forth. Engineers get precise, actionable tasks."

**Q: "What about security/code quality?"**
> A: "The generated PR is a STARTING POINT. Engineers still review, modify, and approve. Think of it as a senior engineer drafting the first version - it's 80% there, you polish the last 20%."

## Practice Recommendations

1. **Run through 3-5 times** before actual demo
2. **Time yourself** - should be 90 seconds or less
3. **Practice transitions** between screens
4. **Memorize key phrases** (Hybrid AI, 30 seconds, receipts-first)
5. **Test backup plan** (video/screenshots ready)
6. **Have teammate watch** and give feedback

**Good luck! You've got this! 🚀**
