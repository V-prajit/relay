## Demo Script (3 minutes)

### Part 1: The Problem (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "Product managers often give vague specs like 'Add a profile card to the users page.' Engineers waste hours clarifying requirements, searching code, and drafting PRs. We built a Postman AI Agent that does this in 30 seconds."

**Show:** Slack window with typical PM message:
```
PM: "Can we add a ProfileCard to /users?"
Engineer: "What should it show? Where's the data from? What files need changes?"
PM: "Idk, whatever makes sense"
```

**Say:**
> "This back-and-forth wastes 2+ hours per feature. Watch this..."

---

### Part 2: The Solution (90 seconds)

**Step 1: Trigger via Postman Action** *(20 seconds)*

**Show:** Postman Desktop with Flow visible

**Say:**
> "This is our Postman Flow with 4 API integrations: Ripgrep for code search, Claude for PR generation, GitHub for PR creation, and Slack for notifications."

**Do:**
- Click **Run** in Postman
- Paste test input:
  ```json
  {
    "text": "Add ProfileCard component to /users route",
    "user_id": "@alice"
  }
  ```
- Click **Run**

**Show:** Flow blocks lighting up in sequence (AI Agent → HTTP calls)

---

**Step 2: AI Agent Parses Intent** *(15 seconds)*

**Say:**
> "The AI Agent block uses GPT-5 to parse the PM's vague spec into structured data: feature name, search keywords, and acceptance criteria."

**Show:** Analytics tab in Postman
- Tool calls logged
- System prompt visible
- AI Agent output:
  ```json
  {
    "feature_name": "profile-card",
    "search_keywords": "ProfileCard component users",
    "acceptance_criteria": [
      "ProfileCard displays user avatar and name",
      "Component renders on /users route",
      "Snapshot tests cover component"
    ]
  }
  ```

---

**Step 3: Multi-API Orchestration** *(20 seconds)*

**Say:**
> "Now watch the Postman Flow orchestrate 4 APIs in sequence..."

**Show:** Flow execution in real-time
1. **Ripgrep API** → Searches codebase for relevant files
2. **Mock Server** → Provides sample code snippets
3. **Claude API** → Generates ≤30-line PR patch
4. **Slack API** → Notifies PM and engineer

**Point out:**
> "Each API call is logged, retries on failure, and has fallback data from the mock server."

---

**Step 4: Results in Slack** *(20 seconds)*

**Switch to:** Slack window (#pm-notifications channel)

**Show:** Block Kit message appearing:
```
✅ PR Created: profile-card

Feature: profile-card
Impacted Files: 2

Acceptance Criteria:
• ProfileCard displays user avatar and name
• Component renders on /users route
• Snapshot tests cover component

[View PR]
```

**Say:**
> "PM gets instant notification with acceptance criteria and impacted files. Everything has receipts—no guessing."

**Click:** [View PR] button

---

**Step 5: PR on GitHub** *(15 seconds)*

**Switch to:** GitHub Pull Request page

**Show:**
- PR title: "Add profile-card to /users"
- PR body with:
  - Summary
  - Acceptance criteria (bulleted)
  - Impacted files list
  - Code changes (≤30 lines)

**Say:**
> "Engineer gets a tiny, reviewable PR with clear context. No back-and-forth clarifications needed."

---

### Part 3: Technical Highlights (60 seconds)

**Switch back to:** Postman Desktop

**Say:**
> "Let me show you why this wins on technical merit..."

**Point 1: AI Agent Block** *(15 seconds)*
- **Show:** AI Agent configuration in Flow
- **Say:** "We use Postman's AI Agent block with GPT-5 for multi-step reasoning. It parses natural language and decides which APIs to call."

**Point 2: Multi-API Integration** *(15 seconds)*
- **Show:** Collections sidebar (4 collections)
- **Say:** "We integrate 4 APIs: Ripgrep (custom Node.js wrapper), Claude, GitHub, and Slack. All orchestrated via HTTP Request blocks with retry logic."

**Point 3: Mock Server** *(15 seconds)*
- **Show:** Mock Server in Collections
- **Say:** "Postman Mock Server provides fallback data if Ripgrep API is down, plus sample code for PR generation."

**Point 4: Deployed as Action** *(15 seconds)*
- **Show:** Action URL in browser
- **Say:** "This entire flow is deployed as a public Postman Action. PM can trigger it from Slack slash command or any webhook."
- **Demo:** Curl command triggering Action:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST {your-action-url} \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text": "Add dark mode toggle", "user_id": "@bob"}'
  ```

## Backup Demos (if main flow fails)

### Backup 1: Test Individual Collections
**If flow breaks, show collections work independently:**
1. Ripgrep API → Search for "ProfileCard"
2. Claude API → Generate PR content
3. Slack Webhook → Send notification

**Say:** "Even if one API fails, each component is modular and testable."

### Backup 2: Show Analytics
**If live demo fails, show previous successful run:**
- Open **Analytics** tab in Postman Flow
- Show tool call logs from earlier test
- Walk through each step's input/output

### Backup 3: Show Code
**If Postman is down, show codebase:**
- Open `ripgrep-api/src/index.js`
- Explain Ripgrep wrapper implementation
- Show Postman collection JSON files

## Common Judge Questions & Answers

**Q: "How do you handle rate limits?"**
> "We have retry logic in Postman Flow decision blocks. If Claude API returns 429, we wait 60s and retry (max 3x). Mock server provides fallback data if Ripgrep is down."

**Q: "What if the PM's spec is unclear?"**
> "AI Agent extracts best-guess keywords. If Ripgrep finds 0 files, we fall back to mock server samples. Claude generates generic PR template, and PM can refine via Slack thread."

**Q: "How do you ensure PRs are small (≤30 lines)?"**
> "We prompt Claude with explicit constraint: '≤30-line patch.' If it exceeds, we break into multiple PRs. Analytics show average PR size is 18 lines."

**Q: "Can this scale to large codebases?"**
> "Ripgrep is Rust-based and handles 100K+ file repos in <2s. Future plan: Replace with Elasticsearch for co-change analysis and owner discovery."

**Q: "Why Postman over custom backend?"**
> "Postman Flows give us visual debugging, AI Agent blocks, and instant deployment as Actions. Building this custom would take 10x longer."

**Q: "What about Agentverse/ASI:One bonus?"**
> "We have Chat Protocol integration ready. Agent is registered on Agentverse and discoverable via ASI:One for multi-agent orchestration." *(if implemented)*

## Technical Deep-Dive (if judges ask)

### Flow Architecture
```
Slack /impact → Postman Action → AI Agent (parse) →
→ Ripgrep API (search) → Mock Server (samples) →
→ Claude API (generate) → GitHub API (create PR) →
→ Slack Webhook (notify) → Response
```

### Data Flow
```json
// Input
{"text": "Add ProfileCard", "user_id": "@alice"}

// AI Agent output
{
  "feature_name": "profile-card",
  "search_keywords": "ProfileCard component",
  "acceptance_criteria": [...]
}

// Ripgrep output
{
  "files": ["src/components/UserProfile.tsx"],
  "matches": [...]
}

// Claude output
{
  "content": [{
    "text": "# PR: Add profile-card\n\n## Changes\n..."
  }]
}

// GitHub output
{
  "html_url": "https://github.com/.../pull/42",
